# Hospitality Revenue Insights (POWERBI PROJECT)

 This project is based on a real dataset of Atliq Grands multiple five star hotels.Business Problem I found : 
> They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.
